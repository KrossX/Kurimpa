Description and information
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, a software plugin for PSX emulators. It's just the base for a 
hardware plugin for the same platform.

Requires OpenGL 3.1 support.
No settings, and no INI either.

Keys:
ALT+ENTER, fullscreen toggle
MULT, toggle filtering (not for 24bpp mode)
F9, vsync toggle
F11, show vram
PRINT SCREEN, window screenshot + vram..shot


If you get a DLL error, you probably need install the runtimes:
